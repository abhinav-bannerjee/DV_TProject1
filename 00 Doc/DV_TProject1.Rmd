###General Steps
1. Find the .csv data of census on surname in 1990 and 2000 online.
2. create the repository in Github.
3 create project with four directories.
4.Using R_etl.r to reformat our datas and import data into ORACL SQL.

```





###visualization

This visualization shows the most efficient vehicles based on mileage and annual fuel costs incurred on the driver. Naturally, economy class cars tend to be more efficient and cost effective.

This visualization displays the most efficient cars and segments car models based on transmission and drive type. Front 2-wheel driven cars seem to be most efficient.

This visualization breaks down cars by manufacturer and make. It then proceeds to aggregate fuel efficiency ratings for each car (and distinguishes between transmission types). Sports vehicles are clearly below the median mileage here.
